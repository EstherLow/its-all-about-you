# It's All About You
You're now a fully fledged full-stack developer, up to speed with many of the latest development technologies (such as real-time communication using websockets) and techniques (such as building Single-Page-Apps using frontend JavaScript frameworks like React & Vue). Now is the time to make sure that everyone else can easily see how much you know.

For this Mini-Project you're going to build your personal website. Ideally it should be a SPA using the frontend framework you've just learnt or another one you find interesting. In addition, you may want to incoroprate real-time communcation using websockets, you could for instance add:
- a live chat for employers to talk to you in real-time
- an activity feed that shows what you're currently working on based on github commits etc
- a social media stream of your tweets, instagram posts etc
- a real-time mini game to hook attention
- something else really cool that we've not thought of

## Design
This project will likely be the first thing recruiters see about you, so make it look great. You can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, SemanticUI, or Materialize. You can even start with a template if you like (though that doesn't really show off your CSS skills).

You may want to go for a traditional layout or you may want to make [something more creative](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-personal-websites), the choice is yours.
