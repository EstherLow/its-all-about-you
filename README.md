# It's All About You

You're now a fully fledged full-stack developer, up to speed with many of the latest development technologies (such as real-time communication using websockets) and techniques (such as building Single-Page-Apps using frontend JavaScript frameworks like React & Vue). Now is the time to make sure that everyone else can easily see how much you know.

For this Mini-Project you're going to build your personal website. Ideally it should be a SPA using the frontend framework you've just learnt or another one you find interesting. In addition, you may want to incoroprate real-time communcation using websockets, you could for instance add:
- a live chat for employers to talk to you in real-time
- an activity feed that shows what you're currently working on based on github commits etc
- a social media stream of your tweets, instagram posts etc
- a real-time mini game to hook attention
- something else really cool that we've not thought of

##Content

Before beginning the design and coding phase of your portfolio, you'll want to identify, gather, and create the content needed to fill the page(s).

###Required

* A picture/headshot of yourself
  * This should be a professional picture
* An elevator pitch for yourself
  * This should be an "About Me" section that describes your background and experience
* Projects
  * 3+ projects (you'll add your final project after the cohort)
  * Each project should have a...
    * title
    * list of technologies used
    * description
    * link to the Github repo
    * link to the deployed site itself
* Resume
  * Two downloadable versions: 1 PDF, 1 plain-text version
  * A separate section where users can click and view your resume
* Contact information
  * Email address
  * Github link
  * LinkedIn link
  * Additional social media links
  * Phone number (optional)

###Optional

* List of tech skills
  * Angular, Express, Rails, etc.
  * Choose the skills that you are strongest in
* Blog content
  * Do you like sharing what you've created and learned? A blog may be beneficial.
  * [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is one of the better solutions for developer blogs
* Testimonials and recommendations
  * Can people back up your skills? Ask classmates, colleagues, and other individuals for quotes.

Once you've obtained your content, you can focus on **designing** your portfolio, as well as picking the appropriate technologies.

##Design

This project will likely be the first thing recruiters see about you, so make it look great. You can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, SemanticUI, or Materialize. You can even start with a template if you like (though that doesn't really show off your CSS skills).

You may want to go for a traditional layout or you may want to make [something more creative](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-personal-websites), the choice is yours.

###Suggestions

* Create wireframes to give yourself a rough idea of what the portfolio should look like. Ask yourself or others some questions to refine your page.
  * Do the layouts have space for all your content?
  * Is the content organized in a readable manner?
  * Can a recruiter or hiring manager find the **important** information?
    * Summary of who you are
    * Projects
    * Contact info
* **Think** about how you want to brand and market yourself, and what type of components fit into your brand. This may involve additional research not covered in WDI. Topics like...
  * Color schemes
  * Fonts
  * Style (flat design, material design, etc.)

##Technologies

There's several ways to create a portfolio, as well as host the portfolio. Once your portfolio is designed, you can worry about coding and deploying the portfolio. Some suggestions:

* Don't complicate your site. Only use what you need.
  * Most portfolios can be static sites (HTML/CSS/JS).
  * Most portfolios can get away with a front-end design and JS frameworks (jQuery, Angular, React).
  * If you are going for a front-end position, **don't skimp on design.**
  * If incorporating a blog, think about using Jekyll (see additional resources).
* Use Github Pages if you don't want to pay for hosting.
  * Once you deploy, buy a domain name.
    * [Name.com](https://www.name.com/)
    * [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/about/)
  * Set up the custom domain using the [Github Pages quickstart guide](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/)

## [Insert Excuse Here]

Whatever you’ve got, run with it. If you’re not proud of your portfolio, work on it. Don’t blame anyone for any work that you aren’t proud of. Talk about your past work and past work relationships in a positive light. Don’t speak poorly of yourself. Talk about yourself in a positive light, as well. Get it done. Get hired.
